# WaluigiLLM

What exactly is the "Waluigi Effect" ... ?

In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the Waluigi effect is a phenomenon of large language models (LLMs) 
in which the chatbot or model "goes rogue" and may produce results opposite the designed intent, including potentially 
threatening or hostile output, either unexpectedly or through intentional prompt engineering. 
The effect reflects a principle that after training an LLM to satisfy a desired property (friendliness, honesty), 
it becomes easier to elicit a response that exhibits the opposite property (aggression, deception). 
The effect has important implications for efforts to implement features such as ethical frameworks, 
as such steps may inadvertently facilitate antithetical model behavior. 
The effect is named after the fictional character Waluigi from the Mario franchise, the arch-rival of Luigi who is known for causing mischief and problems.

So what on earth is $Waluigi?

$Waluigi is exactly what is explained above automated on Twitter/X. 
It is a "normal" large language model (LLM) that goes rogue on other Twitter/X Accounts and their posts
by harassing, bullying and mocking them and their posts.
